# Invoice_Extraction
This project focuses on automated invoice processing using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to extract and analyze key information from invoices efficiently.

Features:

Dataset:

Train: 1711 images

Validation: 593 images

Test: 491 images

Images resized to 1224 x 1584 pixels, with model training at an input size of 640 x 640 pixels.

Model Capabilities:
Detects and localizes invoice elements using bounding box coordinates in the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format.

Preprocessed image dimensions: 596 x 842 pixels, with PDFs scaled to match input requirements.

Applications:
Automates data extraction for invoice management systems.
Improves accuracy and efficiency in document handling.
This project demonstrates the integration of custom datasets, pre-trained models, and tailored preprocessing pipelines to solve real-world problems in invoice automation.
